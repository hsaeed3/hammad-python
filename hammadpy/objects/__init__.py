"""âœ¼ hammadpy.objects

A collection of resources that provide 'cookie-cutter' functionality,
and are meant to represent very literal services / objects / resources
that are commonly used in python & application development, with extended
functionality and some opinionated design choices.

These objects include things such as:
- `hammadpy.objects.logger.Logger`
- `hammadpy.objects.cache.Cache`
